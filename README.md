# Amit's Dirty Code Repository

This repository contains a Python script `dirty_code.py` with various inefficient coding practices and their corresponding test cases in `test_dirty.py`. The intent of this repository is to illustrate common coding violations and inefficiencies that can be found in Python code.

## Files

- **dirty_code.py**: Contains functions demonstrating inefficiencies such as unnecessary loops, inefficient string operations, excessive memory usage, unnecessary imports, and more.

- **test_dirty.py**: Contains test cases to validate the functionality of the code provided in `dirty_code.py`.

## Requirements

- Python 

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Amitanand983/amit_code.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the repository directory**:
   ```bash
   cd amit_code
   ```

3. **Run the Python script**:
   ```bash
   python dirty_code.py
   ```

4. **Run the test cases** (ensure you have a testing framework like `unittest` or `pytest`):
   ```bash
   python -m unittest test_dirty.py
   ```
